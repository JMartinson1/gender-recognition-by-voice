Unit 1, page 12, conversation listening.

2MM
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,560
Conversation 1.

3MM
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,920
So, nice to meet you.

4FF
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,760
You too.

5MM
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,780
Where are you from?

6FF
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,060
From? I'm from here.

7FF
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,340
Well, near here.

8FF
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,480
I live just outside the city in the suburbs with my family.

9MM
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,180
The suburbs, that's nice.

10MM
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,340
And do you have a hobby?

11FF
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,220
Who has time for hobbies?

12FF
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,380
Um, I guess I like studying.

13MM
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,320
Studying?

14FF
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:34,320
Yeah, well, that's what I do most of the time. I want to work, get a good job later. So studying is what I'm into right now.

15MM
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,900
Well, good luck with that.

16FF
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,400
Thanks. How about you?

17MM
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,720
Me? I like to draw and design stuff.

18MM
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,240
Conversation 2.

19FF
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,520
So, do you live by yourself or with your family?

20FF
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,660
I live alone. I got an apartment in the center of the city.

21FF
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,440
Downtown?

22FF
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,500
Yeah, right. It's not so convenient, but, um, it's okay.

23FF
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,820
I miss my family sometimes.

24FF
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,480
Really?

25FF
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,680
Yeah, except for my brother and his guitar.

26FF
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,360
It's so noisy. Pardon me?
SHOULD BE SPLIT

27FF
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,280
I said I don't miss my brother.

28FF
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,000
Now I can listen to the music that I really want to.

29FF
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,400
Because you have your own place. That's right.

30MM
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,600
Conversation 3.

31MM
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:31,200
So, how about you? Do you live near here too? No, I wish. My home, my family is way out in the country.
SHOULD BE SPLIT F THEN M		     /

32FF
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,580
A rural area? You couldn't get an apartment close to here?

33MM
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,520
No, I can't afford to. So I commute back and forth. It takes over two hours.

34FF
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,700
Oh my gosh, two hours?

35MM
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,140
But it's okay. I can watch movies and TV programs on my video player.

36FF
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,600
Ah, so you're into movies. Cool.

37MM
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:55,520
I used to play video games with my brother at home, but now I'm almost never at home.

38FF
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,640
Yeah, I see.

39MM
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,200
Conversation 4.

40FF
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,960
Hey, I saw you on the train earlier today.

41MM
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,660
Oh yeah?

42FF
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,540
So, I guess you live far from here?

43MM
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,980
No, no, no, no. Actually, I live in a neighborhood, uh, not too far. Kind of, you know, nearby.

44MM X F
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,600
Pardon me?

45MM
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,300
I said I live nearby, with my family.

46FF
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,380
So, why were you on the train earlier?

47MM
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,300
I was hanging out with my friends a little while ago.

48MM
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,620
That's pretty much what I do in my free time.

49FF
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,380
Hanging out with friends? Me too.

50MM X F
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,560
I don't like being alone.

51MM
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,240
Alone, yeah.

52FF
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:32,940
Exactly.
