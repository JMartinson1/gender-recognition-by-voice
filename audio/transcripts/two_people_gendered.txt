Unit 1, Page 12, Conversation Listening.

2M
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,360
Conversation 1.

3M
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,860
So, nice to meet you.

4F
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,580
You too.

5F	X
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,600
Where are you from?

6F
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,260
From? I'm from here. Well, near here.

7F
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,420
I live just outside the city in the suburbs with my family.

8M
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,920
The suburbs? That's nice.

9M
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,240
And do you have a hobby?

10F
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,000
Who has time for hobbies?

11F
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,160
Um, I guess I like studying.

12M
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:26,980
Studying?

13F
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, well, that's what I do most of the time. I want to work, get a good job later,

14M	X	TWO SPEAKERS, F THEN M
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,880
so studying is what I'm into right now. Well, good luck with that.

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,340
Thanks! How about you? Me? I like to draw and design stuff.

MISSED CONVERSATION 2

16M	X	TWO SPEAKERS, F THEN F
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:52,420
So, do you live by yourself or with your family? I live alone.

17F	X	TWO SPEAKERS, F THEN M
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,240
I got an apartment in the center of the city. Downtown?

18F
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,480
Yeah, right. It's not so convenient, but, um, it's okay. I miss my family sometimes.

19F
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,140
Really? Yeah, except for my brother and his guitar. It's so noisy.

20F
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,940
Pardon me? I said I don't miss my brother. Now I can listen to the music that I really want to.

21F
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,260
Because you have your own place. That's right.

22M
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Conversation 3

23M
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:31,140
So, how about you? Do you live near here too? No, I wish. My home, my family is way out in the country.

24M
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:40,340
A rural area? You couldn't get an apartment close to here? No, I can't afford to. So, I commute back and forth. It takes over two hours.

25M
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:49,780
Oh my gosh, two hours? But it's okay. I can watch movies and TV programs on my video player. Ah, so you're into movies? Cool!

26M
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,360
I used to play video games with my brother at home, but now I'm almost never at home.

27F
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,520
Yeah, I see.

28M
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,180
Conversation 4

29F
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,840
Hey, I saw you on the train earlier today.

30M
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,460
Oh yeah?

31F
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,520
So, I guess you live far from here?

32M
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:16,640
No, no, no, actually I live in a neighborhood, uh, not too far, kind of, you know, nearby.

33M
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,540
Pardon me?

34M
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,260
I said I live nearby, with my family. So, why were you on the train earlier?

35M
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,860
I was hanging out with my friends a little while ago. That's pretty much what I do in

36M
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,020
my free time. Hanging out with friends? Me too. I don't like being alone.

37M
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,680
Alone, yeah. Exactly.
