1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
she says, there was a mean trick with the vomitin,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:03,720
all that.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,340
I don't know, it kind of spells it new.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,480
Yes, you do all the time.

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,300
Well, mine are always funnier.

6
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,640
They have an ironic sort of twist.

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,020
I cast Tasha's hideous laugh, too.

8
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,280
I think.

9
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,460
Make a saving throw if you'd be so kind

10
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,980
for Tasha's hideous laughter.

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:19,800
Oh.

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,320
Would you roll?

13
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,060
Four.

14
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,360
Do I have points to add to it?

15
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,920
Does she like, reverse it at her?

16
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,120
That she does.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,060
Whoa!

18
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,400
That's badass.

19
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,620
I know, that's just a fucking badass.

20
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,820
I can't do the school laughing, you're like a crazy bitch.

21
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,620
This is just, oh no.

22
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,080
This is just so cool.

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,660
I love Shizuko.

24
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,040
Make a, what's your roll for your wisdom save?

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,640
Four plus wisdom.

26
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,240
Plus wisdom, four's not gonna do it.

27
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:50,560
Great.

28
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,820
You start cackling like a lunatic.

29
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:54,660
Ah!

30
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,160
No.

31
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,400
I also need to have you make a wisdom saving throw

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,820
for your panic attack condition.

33
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,600
20. 18 plus two.

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,380
18 plus two, cool.

35
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,560
So you don't go into a panic attack,

36
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,820
but you do start laughing like a lunatic.

37
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,700
You see, she says, see, for example,

38
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,900
I just said that my spells were funny,

39
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,180
and I've turned your laughter spell back on you,

40
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,840
with both ironic and funny,

41
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,880
which are the two things that I said my spells are like,

42
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,520
and I didn't even have to use a spell slot.

43
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,260
Isn't that something to learn so many spells

44
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,300
for you?

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,280
This is my only game going to this school

46
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,460
to find a group of people to destroy you in a fucking life.

47
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,720
You see, she says, I'm sure you will.

48
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,720
You're going to join one of those little arcane secret societies.

49
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,680
I punch her in the face.

50
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,160
Go ahead and make an attack roll.

51
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,720
Did you use up all your spells slots on your sister?

52
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,480
He just died in your opening.

53
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,860
Three. Three.

54
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,620
You went, your skinny, elven fist whiffs right past your face,

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,480
and she says, that's sort of pure, brute, physical violence.

56
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,620
I'm sure we'll earn you all sorts of credits

57
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,680
at this school for brawling, and it's lovely.

58
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,240
Well done.

59
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,900
You see, she says, can I, before you injure yourself

60
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:15,140
by trying to attack me, can I just be very clear

61
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,600
about something?

62
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,280
Look, she says, I,

63
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,600
it's awful that you got kicked out of Xutong.

64
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,860
It's awful.

65
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,320
It doesn't reflect well on our family,

66
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,640
but that's not even the reason.

67
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,380
I punch her in the face.

68
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,800
Good point again.

69
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,140
Eight.

70
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:36,680
Eight.

71
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,820
She says, really stop.

72
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,680
What's the game at this point?

73
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,820
I'm throwing punches.

74
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,640
The game is me hitting you in the face.

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,540
She says, I'm trying to help.

76
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,480
No, you're trying to help yourself.

77
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,300
No, look, all right, I just, let me do,

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,860
I'm trying to do a nice older sister thing for once.

79
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,000
Can I do it? Can I do that?

80
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,260
Can you?

81
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,840
Good grief. All right.

82
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,580
Look, egg fort doesn't work like you, doll, all right?

83
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,880
So all the things about grades and tests and practicals

84
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,420
and exams and all that, that's all out.

85
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,880
It's a nonsense place.

86
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,700
It's all topsy-turvy there, all right?

87
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,700
They look differently on the sort of things

88
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,620
that they value there.

89
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,880
So the things that really, really work for that academy are sort of things that would

90
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,020
be insane to do at Xutong. I heard that one of the best ways to get into an arcane society

91
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,320
was to steal a book from the restricted section on your first day. That that's something that

92
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,160
they look at as, I don't know, some kind of adventurer's initiative or it shows, I don't

93
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,100
know, gumption, something along those lines. I don't want to take it any more advice from

94
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,300
you because you probably couldn't even get into egg fort just because you're good at

95
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,140
a huge old, doesn't mean you'd be good at egg fort.

96
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,260
I could do that. I could turn that whole school around brick by brick.

97
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,300
I'm lifting up in the air. You're too scared to try. You're too scared to try.

98
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,920
I am proper and well behaved and well mannered.

99
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,720
So I don't care to engage this anymore.

100
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,900
All right, fine. Go on your first day. Get partnered up with some sort of barbarian.

101
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,160
Go out into the wilds and get killed on your first adventure. See what I care.

102
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,900
Good. I shall. See she walks away.

103
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,340
Whoa.

104
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,960
10 choose.

105
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,460
Hell yeah.

106
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,220
We now go over to...

107
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,280
Hell yeah.

108
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:38,300
Going out to Ballister, which is kind of like, you know, more rundown, more seedy kind of place, kind of bad part of town.

109
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:47,160
We see a strong tower luxury apartments with the luxury kind of arcano crystals flickering.

110
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,580
So it just goes to strong tower apartments.

111
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:58,480
We see that there is a small bedroom and basically like, you know, like a kind of retrofitted,

112
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,500
like it's like a one bedroom apartment with like a kind of cordoned off, you know, like

113
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
bed in the living room with like a fake drywall around it. Very small apartment.

114
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:17,160
And we see that there's like, sun's just coming up. There's like, you know, some smoke coming from like,

115
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,420
you know, some burning thing on the other and there's a little bit of like coffee and a mug.

116
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:30,460
A very sparse Spartan kind of place. And we see Riz Guck Gack. Brian, go ahead and describe Riz for me.

117
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:42,120
Yeah, so I'm Riz Guck Gack. My nickname in middle school was briefcase kid. I'm a goblin. And I don't

118
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,280
have a lot of friends, even though I'm pretty social, which is weird. My only real friend was

119
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,880
his halfling named Penny Luckstone, who technically my babysitter, I had a babysitter until I was 13,

120
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,860
but she recently went missing.

121
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:05,080
And my mom is a detective and I'm a licensed private investigator.

122
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,140
So I am gonna find Penny myself.

123
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,180
So it's early in the morning.

124
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,440
I assume you've been up all night, working your case.

125
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,080
I've got my board that just has the missing girls

126
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,380
all just pointed at the school.

127
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,240
And that's all I have.

128
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,220
Ew, that's so creepy to have a little boys room.

129
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,000
I just have a board of missing girls.

130
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,900
He's trying to find them.

131
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,160
Whatever, Greep.

132
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,640
You're not here.

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,420
You're not here.

134
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,300
None of you are here.

135
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,000
You know you take breaks and kiss a pillow.

136
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,600
Penny, thank you.

137
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,360
So Riz is there not kissing a pillow?

138
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,140
Just being a private investigator.

139
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,660
You see that it's early in the morning.

140
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,100
You're kind of looking at the board.

141
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,920
It's a lot of, it's a really nice board.

142
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,020
You got with the yarn and everything.

143
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,560
It's kind of sparse clues-wise.

144
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,240
It's sort of just the pictures and the dates

145
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,760
where they went missing and stuff like that.

146
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,700
Trying to move it around to make it different,

147
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,380
but I only have five clues.

148
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,380
You see that the door opens and your mom, Sklonda,

149
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,340
got Gakwaks in.

150
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,140
Sklonda's a classic goblin.

151
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,100
She's got sort of like green skin, yellow eyes,

152
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,780
the big ears that come out to each side.

153
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,600
But it's got that classic mom haircut, you know what I mean?

154
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,120
Kind of like the bangs and the kind of bob or whatever.

155
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,780
She wants to get the sort of white shirt.

156
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,580
She's got an underarm holster for a little arcubus dress.

157
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,920
She wants to get like the badge hanging off the belt there.

158
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,720
You see that she opens the door, walks in.

159
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,060
She's been gone all night working.

160
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,600
You see that she walks in and she goes,

161
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,280
ah Riz, sweetie, are you up?

162
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,260
You're up? What are you doing?

163
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,240
I got some sleep.

164
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,360
I slept for four hours.

165
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,600
So he said four hours was the minimum.

166
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,920
Four hours was the minimum.

167
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,840
I got four hours of sleep.

168
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,040
Okay.

169
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,240
I got up a couple of times to work on the board,

170
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,800
but for the most part, four hours of sleep.

171
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,620
Sweetie, you know that it's not great that you're doing this, right?

172
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,420
Well, they're, you know, they're missing.

173
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,980
Why does this say licensed private investigator?

174
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,660
It says, well, it says, it's little, but it's legal.

175
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,580
Looks like a smudge. Oh, sweetie, that's...

176
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,020
Technically legal. Really skirting the line.

177
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,280
But overall okay.

178
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,960
Yeah, I look sweetheart, you got a lot of gumption, but we have detectives that are working. Actually,

179
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,140
we have one detective working this case, but... And I can be a man on the inside. And the inside.

180
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,380
Yeah. The egg at the school, right? That's where the girls all went to the school. Yes,

181
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,920
they all went to egg four. And that's the clue that I have. She looks at your one clue.

182
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,540
She looks at me for it. She says, okay, you could throw a couple more clues on there. There's

183
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,900
a couple of things we could, you know... Just read a newspaper. Yeah, we'll just read a newspaper.

184
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,380
The dates, right? You got circumstances. Last scene, last person scene. That's why it's

185
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,660
good to have you around, mom. Why am I encouraging this? Don't do this. Skriveling dates. Don't...

186
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:04,420
Oh, God. Okay. Are you hungry? Are you hungry? What's the need? I had coffee. That's not food,

187
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,960
sweetie. I haven't eaten. Okay, I'm gonna go and get some. What do we have? She opens the

188
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,700
fridge and it's empty and she says, okay, I gotta go shopping. You see that she opens the thing

189
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,400
and there's some cereal. She takes a little thing of cereal out, pours two bowls, pours some

190
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,740
milk in. You see that there's not enough milk for two bowls so that she pours the milk out

191
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,940
of her bowl into yours and puts water from the sink in it. And you see, she puts it in

192
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:40,820
front of you. And you see that she goes... Don't cry. Don't cry. Try your best. I love her.

193
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,560
You see, she says... Shout out, mom. All right. Well, heat up, okay? Okay, thank you.

194
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,820
All right, well, I'll find a time to go shopping and get the rest.

195
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,380
Hey, today, first day of school, right? Yeah.

196
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:08,920
And this Saturday, you know, it's the five-year anniversary.

197
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:15,080
So if you wanna head over to the cemetery, we can go visit dad

198
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,440
and sort of see how things are going. Yeah, we can do that.

199
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,100
Does that work for you? Yeah. We can go in the morning.

200
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,560
If you got stuff to do, because I know you probably try to make friends at school.

201
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,240
Yeah, I'm probably gonna be busy because I'm gonna make...

202
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,100
So I figured a lot of kids would just be giving out their phone numbers on their phone,

203
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,160
but I made business cards.

204
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,780
So I'll probably be busy Saturday. Why don't we do it in the morning?

205
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,360
Yeah. Formality is great when you're trying to be a professional.

206
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,360
And I know that you see me work a lot, and so that's kind of a professionalism.

207
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,020
But there's something to be said. When I go out with the guys, I'll knock back a beer.

208
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,360
I'll kick back a little bit. It's okay to relax.

209
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,520
Yeah, get them relaxed.

210
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,980
Do get them relaxed?

211
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,840
That's how we get them to tell us...

212
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,920
You relax.

213
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,160
...the secrets so that we can solve the mystery.

214
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,960
Friends are for more than clues, sweetie.

215
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,920
Friends are for...

216
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,460
There's a lot of things we use friends for, right?

217
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,840
So let's look at that as an opportunity to...

218
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,660
Start with the friends, then get the clues.

219
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,180
Okay.

220
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,520
You get to the bus.

221
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,240
I'm gonna try to...

222
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,540
All right, I'm gonna catch a little bit of sleep.

223
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,760
Sweetheart, you're gonna do great.

224
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,560
Thanks, Mom.

225
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,940
You're the best there is.

226
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,420
I love you.

227
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,380
Have a great day at school.

228
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Tell Mom about when you get home, okay?

229
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,300
Okay, thanks, Mom.

230
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,000
It gives you a kiss on the head, and she heads off to her bedroom.

231
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:44,460
And we will now cut over to our final...

232
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,940
Nice.

233
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,540
Oh, hell yeah! We cut over to the Fayeth home, way over by the highway.

234
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,600
Not so many people live out here. It's kind of a little house, chain-link fence.

235
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,120
It's kind of a little attic bedroom up there.

236
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,500
Ooh, I live... I'm in the attic?

237
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,140
You're in the attic.

238
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,740
Fuck yeah.

239
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:10,280
Upstairs is a room that last year was filled with pastels and little unicorns and other shit like that.

240
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,860
And now it's all fucking banned posters, tour lists for who's gonna be playing the black pit.

241
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,620
There's a sick red guitar in the corner. There's some like horn cream.

242
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,500
There's like some cream for like kind of like your horns that are coming in.

243
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,660
See... Emily, go ahead and describe your character if you would.

244
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:35,340
My name's Figaroff. You probably know me last year. It's like that really bubbly girl who was like invited to every party.

245
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:44,560
But all of a sudden my horns started growing in and I thought I was an elf, but it turns out my dad isn't my real dad.

246
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:52,540
And I have a demon for a dad, but my mom won't tell me who he is. So pretty much I'm kind of like, fuck everyone.

247
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,800
And I'm just like, I'm just like, I've got a bass guitar.

248
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,960
I've got some drumsticks.

249
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,440
Like I'm ready to start a bass-driven band.

250
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,580
And just like, yeah, just fuck everything.

251
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,720
Right? Okay, that's it.

252
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,060
That's me. Also, my name is Figaroff.

253
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,700
My last name is Faith, but that is the name of someone

254
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,580
who does not have anything to do with me

255
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,400
because he's not my dad.

256
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,660
So I'm just Fig now. Just Fig.

257
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,160
You see that, so Fig is upstairs.

258
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,580
You see that there's a knock at the door. You're in bed.

259
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:37,180
See that your mom leans in. Your mom is, she's got like the mom jeans on, but it's like a sort of wood elf.

260
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,600
You see that she's got like a bow over her shoulder in a quiver of air.

261
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,160
Your mom wears this arranger that goes and explores the woods around here.

262
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,740
You see she goes, sweetheart, I've been knocking up a storm. What's going on? You're going to be late. You're going to miss the bus.

263
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,400
Oh yeah, about that, I'm not going.

264
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,240
God damn it, you're going to school.

265
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,680
Yeah, try and tell me even one good bard

266
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,600
who learned how to bard in school.

267
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,020
They're gonna teach me how to play the bass guitar?

268
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,960
No, if I want, I need real life experience.

269
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,300
The school is real life experience.

270
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,580
Sweetie, you're 15.

271
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,520
Who's my dad?

272
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,220
God damn it, I'm not.

273
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,320
Who's my dad?

274
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,840
I can't tell you who you're,

275
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,760
your dad is Galiir who raised you and loves you.

276
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,000
Okay. That tool.

277
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,360
Look, just cause things aren't great between your father

278
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,420
and I right now doesn't mean that he doesn't love you.

279
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:31,980
Okay?

280
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,040
Really? Because the look on his face

281
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
when my horn started growing in

282
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,120
didn't look a lot like love.

283
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,300
Sweetie, this attitude is a problem.

284
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,220
All right, you got to get it together.

285
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,040
It's your first day at school.

286
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,000
You know what you're right, I think I need some instruction,

287
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,120
like maybe from a dad.

288
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,680
God damn it, I.

289
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,840
Who is he?

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,940
Just give me a name, I'll go find him myself.

291
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,540
There are reasons I can't tell you.

292
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Is he the Nightmare King?

293
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,960
It's not the Nightmare King.

294
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,840
It's not the Nightmare King.

295
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,640
It's the Nightmare King.

296
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,720
It's the Nightmare King.

297
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,160
You don't have to say, say it's not the Nightmare King

298
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,120
if it's the Nightmare King.

299
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,620
Say it, you want me to say what?

300
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,140
If it's not the Nightmare King, you could let me know

301
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,020
by being like, it's not the Nightmare King.

302
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,420
The Nightmare King lives thousands of miles away from here, maybe.

303
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,560
Yeah. I did.

304
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,520
But he also lives in our nightmares.

305
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,340
Maybe that's where you met him.

306
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,600
Sweetie, this is sensitive in adults.

307
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,100
I light up a cigarette.

308
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,440
Where the fuck did you get a cigarette?

309
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,060
She snatches out of your hand.

310
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,500
I don't, where did you get that?

311
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,320
I light up another.

312
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:43,820
God!

313
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,540
Where did this come from?

314
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,460
You were so well-behaved a year ago.

315
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,700
See, she sort of like collapses against the wall.

316
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,600
Look, okay, well, and she looks out the window and goes,

317
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,460
well there goes the fucking bus, huh?

318
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,180
There it goes, are you happy?

319
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,420
Bye.

320
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,340
Anyway, so I think I'm just gonna sort of stay home

321
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,780
and work on some music.

322
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,440
I've got a song called My Dad is a Demon,

323
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,900
but he's also a deadbeat.

324
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,580
So, I'll just work on that.

325
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,420
You're going to the school.

326
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,800
Bye. And you see that she walks out,

327
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,640
picks up the phone, and she calls someone,

328
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,940
you can hear her speaking in elven downstairs, going,

329
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,660
I can't believe it.

330
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,080
I can't believe it.

331
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,700
I thought I was in the elf.

332
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,680
I'm so sorry.

333
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,180
I'm so sorry.

334
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,460
Oh my God, just so many T.H. sounding.

335
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,780
I don't know if I'm a fig.

336
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,340
I know you're talking about me, I can hear you saying fig.

337
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,980
I've got nothing to do with you.

338
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,040
Get downstairs.

339
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,980
You see your mom comes back upstairs and goes,

340
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,040
I have to go to work, all right?

341
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,960
Your father is coming here to pick you up

342
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,180
and take you to school, all right?

343
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,420
Because- Oh my real father?

344
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,500
I'm finally gonna meet him.

345
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,240
What a luxury.

346
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,220
I can't wait.

347
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,040
I'll put on my best fucking dress.

348
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,880
Get dressed for school, all right?

349
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,180
And we will talk about this.

350
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:10,720
I love you, and I know this is hard right now,

351
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,500
but we're gonna get, you gotta put the cigarette out

352
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,280
while I'm in the room.

353
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,760
While I'm in the room, you can't smoke.

354
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,920
I put it out in her closet.

355
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,340
God damn it!

356
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,880
You see that she walks out of the room.

357
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,760
Just tell me who my real dad is

358
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,500
and I'll call this war off.

359
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,180
She walks out of the room, she leaves,

360
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,980
you see that she walks out on the front lawn

361
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,980
and a humongous griffin flies out in the sky.

362
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,560
I'm like, ah!

363
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,560
Lands in the front yard, she mounts on its back and flies off.

364
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,640
Oh, oh.

365
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,100
Okay, that's pretty dope.

366
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,880
You see that a moment later, a car rolls up

367
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,460
and Gilear, who you, not your biological father,

368
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,480
but the man who raised you, steps out of the car.

369
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,060
He's not looking great.

370
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,220
He's sort of lost some hair.

371
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,240
You've never seen an elf with a comb over before.

372
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,120
He's got like a little bit of a punch.

373
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,060
He's got like a little sort of short sleeve button up shirt.

374
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,160
He's like working at a different job now

375
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,340
because he quit his old one and he's got like some,

376
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,480
what do you call it, like beans or something on his shirt?

377
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
Oh, yeah.

378
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,480
You see, he steps out of the car and knocks on the door.

379
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,200
Tunk, tunk, tunk.

380
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,060
Hey, go answer it.

381
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,680
Gilear, have you been eating out of cans again?

382
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,080
What?

383
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,360
Oh, my daughter.

384
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,240
Yes, I have been eating out of cans.

385
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,580
I've been eating legumes, as it were,

386
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,460
for I have found that in my new living situation

387
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,580
over at Strong Tower luxury apartments.

388
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,820
Wow, you really emphasize luxury.

389
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,360
They're not the worst in the world. They're all right.

390
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,540
But I've found that, you know, I've been eating beans.

391
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,500
Eating beans.

392
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,220
Okay. So I'm guessing you were sent here to try and get me to go to school, right?

393
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,400
Well, I'm going to give you a ride.

394
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,560
Okay, let me just go use the bathroom and then I'll come.

395
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,720
Okay, that sounds good.

396
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,340
I go into the bathroom and I cast a sky self to make myself look like my mom.

397
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,520
And then I come back out.

398
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,760
You walk back out and you see he goes, Sandra Lynn, what the hell?

399
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,600
I thought you needed to go to work.

400
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,620
I know, I've changed my mind.

401
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,380
I don't think she should go to school.

402
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,780
She made some really compelling arguments about how Bards,

403
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,300
how Bards need real life experience.

404
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,960
So thank you so much.

405
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,360
And also thank you for keeping it a secret

406
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,720
who her real dad is.

407
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,420
Well, all right.

408
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,780
But between you and me, we can say the name out loud.

409
00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:01,720
So you see, he says, well, he's actually, if you want to go talk to him about the paternity

410
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,500
test, we can, he's free today.

411
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,460
Yeah.

412
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,520
Yes, I do.

413
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,440
Can we do it in the next hour?

414
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,140
Sure, that's fine.

415
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,300
Okay, yes.

416
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:11,860
That's no problem.

417
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,180
Thank you.

418
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,040
Thank you so much.

419
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,940
She's upstairs.

420
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,440
So we can just go.

421
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,840
No need to say goodbye to her.

422
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,300
Really?

423
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,380
No need to say goodbye to her?

424
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,580
No, I think she's working on a song.

425
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,540
Okay, that's right. I'll talk to her later. You see, he goes and gets in the driver's seat

426
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:35,680
of the car. Okay, I'm coming. You sit. What's the duration on your disguise self spell? One

427
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,000
hour.

428
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:51,500
Cool. Everyone else goes to school. That's my friend.

429
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:01,220
The sun rises in the sky over the beautiful dappled lawns, stone brick walls, ivy covered

430
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:07,980
trellises and statues of the Egg Fort Adventuring Academy. All of you arrive by bus, by car, however

431
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,240
you get here. Out in the front of the building, you see a bunch of students, people that recognize

432
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,840
each other, clapping and loud teenagers and everyone's kind of gathering. You see her a few

433
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,840
minutes early. You see that your father pulls up to the front of the school.

434
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:31,180
You got a trick. You see, he goes, all right, Sandra Lynn, here you are, your former lovers

435
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:39,160
in there. You think I'm a fool? I raised you and don't call me Gilear, all right? I know

436
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,740
that I said- What? What else am I supposed to call you, stranger? Stranger with no biological

437
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,500
link to me? I'm willing to make that a lot to say every time I address you. You see little

438
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:56,680
tear forms in his eye and you see he says, I know that I said some hurtful things when

439
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:04,140
I first found out. Yeah, you said you're no longer a faith and guess what, I'm not. I'm

440
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:11,940
just fig now. Fig, I'm sitting here with beans on my shirt. I know, I saw you ate one on the

441
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,800
ride here. I was hungry, all right. I put on some weight. You ever heard of a fat elf?

442
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,380
I never seen a fat elf in my life and I'm here with a bad come over beans on my shirt.

443
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:32,640
Okay, fine. I'm sorry, Gilear. I'm sorry that I got angry at you. You're just some random

444
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,540
man. I shouldn't be mean to you.

445
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:44,380
All right, get out of my fucking car, you demon. I didn't mean it like it's not- No, no,

446
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,380
no, no, because you're making it a tiefling thing.

447
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,040
You know what? I am a demon.

448
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,160
And then I put some hornwax to really make him shoddy.

449
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,920
And I'm not ashamed of it.

450
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,880
I just hope I don't also get a tail.

451
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,980
The horns are enough.

452
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,660
Okay, bye.

453
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,800
Brad, you guys all arrived at the front of the school.

454
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,240
What are you guys all doing here together?

455
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,000
Oh, I look around for the biggest and the strongest man

456
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,240
or student in the kind of the entry area.

457
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,460
You look around.

458
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,160
You see, what's Gorygug doing?

459
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,940
He's the tallest person here.

460
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,160
I'm holding a metal flower.

461
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,560
I was looking for a friend.

462
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,500
I walked straight up to Gorygug and I say, hey, how you doing, buddy?

463
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm good. It's my first day. I guess it's everyone's first day.

464
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,280
Oh, it's your first day.

465
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,240
Do you want this metal flower?

466
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,140
I swear you're hitting the fucking wall.

467
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,320
I'm not gonna fucking care.

468
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,660
I see this just as I'm walking into the wall.

469
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,300
I'm like, this is what this school is.

470
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,340
Go ahead and roll an attack roll.

471
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:55,800
Great.

472
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,640
Great.

473
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,800
15.

474
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:00,760
What's your AC?

475
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,980
My AC is 13.

476
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,260
You slug him. What's your strength modifier?

477
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,480
It's two.

478
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,840
You take three points of damage.

479
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,380
And then I turn and I say, I'm Fabian's feet.

480
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,480
I'm Seacaster, son of Bill Seacaster.

481
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,940
And I'm here to be great.

482
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,380
I'm trying to sing that song.

483
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,880
I run up.

484
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
I run up.

485
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,420
I run up.

486
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,560
I run up.

487
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,120
I run up.

488
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,700
Are you okay?

489
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,940
What happened?

490
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,720
That guy punched me.

491
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,740
That sucks.

492
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,880
You seem really nonviolent.

493
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,320
I think that's really cool.

494
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,580
Violence is never the answer.

495
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,340
I go to a rage.

496
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,340
What?

497
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,580
Awesome. What are you?

498
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,100
I go to a rage and I attack.

499
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,340
I go to punch.

500
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,120
Go for it. Roll an attack roll.

501
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,140
Oh.

502
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,640
19.

503
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,520
What's your AC?

504
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,280
Oh, 16.

505
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,000
And you're in a rage, right?

506
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,380
Yes.

507
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,480
So that's gonna deal three plus two plus one

508
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,740
is six points of damage.

509
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,300
No.

510
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,440
You fucking...

511
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:19,300
Gorgug whips up and fucking clocks. Wait, no, violence isn't the answer. Is this creating

512
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,260
like a commotion? Are there people in the... Are the teachers all around? You see there's

513
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,280
this one kid who looks like a gnome with like that long kind of like stoner hair

514
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,660
who's like, oh fuck, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight. You can start going fucking crazy.

515
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,380
I'm gonna sneak into the teachers lounge while there's a commotion and steal from the refrigerator.

516
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:49,260
You sneak in. You guys see that way into the crowd of students is this hulking dragonborn.

517
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,680
For those who don't know, the dragonborn is humanoid dragons, long tail, no wings, these big claws,

518
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,880
wearing a full suit, like a gray suit and a blue tie, big horns sweeping off of like this,

519
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,700
he's like red scaled anthropomorphic dragon guy. You see he's holding just a straight up cricket bat

520
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,600
in his hands and he walks up and goes, all right, all right,

521
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,280
that's enough and on day one, the bell hasn't even rung yet.

522
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,580
Effortlessly hoists you two up off the ground,

523
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,060
sheathing his cricket bat before he does so and goes,

524
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,800
no, look here, what, what, what are you, freshman?

525
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,660
How, why did this even start?

526
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,920
Well, I don't know.

527
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,320
You hit me.

528
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,780
Well, I had to let this one know that I wasn't going to take any of the shit.

529
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,300
Shit, it looks like he's holding a phone.

530
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,100
He's holding a flower.

531
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:41,680
Hey, the greatest attackers sometimes put up a facade

532
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,040
that they might sneak their way.

533
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,280
I don't need to explain myself to you, I'm Fabian Seacaster.

534
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,800
You 100% need to explain yourself to me.

535
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,800
I am Vice Principal Golden Horde.

536
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,780
I'm sorry I got mad at you.

537
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,000
You can still have the flower if you want.

538
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,380
Don't kid, don't kid.

539
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,740
I'm in the background praying.

540
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,560
He has absolutely not earned any congeniality for you at all.

541
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,000
I hit him too, so I'm worried that.

542
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,320
All right, that's immediate detention for both of you.

543
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,700
First day after school.

544
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,920
Fine.

545
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,960
All right, you see he gives you each a little red slip

546
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,500
and says, good grief, is there any other nonsense

547
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,420
happening here?

548
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,680
Good, behave yourselves and I'll see you at detention

549
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,140
after school. I'm so sorry. Red, you go to sneak it,

550
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,000
give me a stealth check. Oh, I don't know if that's really a skill I have.

551
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,820
Okay, I got an at one.

552
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,020
Your pulse is instantly in some trouble.

553
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,400
You walk into the teacher's lounge, you are in there for literally,

554
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
what do you steal as you go in there?

555
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,900
I'm just going through the fridge seeing what kind of food there is.

556
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:11,460
You see that there is a little Tupperware container with a transparent steak in it?

557
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,680
You can partially see through or ethereal. You see it says, ghost steak, please do not

558
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,220
eat for a ghost professor. Yeah, I'm gonna eat that. I take the ghost steak and I just

559
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,720
start eating it. You have a very fucking hard time grabbing it.

560
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,980
Fuck.

561
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:34,760
You see the door opens and this vice principal guy walks in and goes, okay, immediate detention.

562
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,500
We are three for three and I'm about to ring the first bell.

563
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,720
The crazy thing is you're just playing into my hand.

564
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,100
Welcome to my game, you just did exactly what I wanted you to do.

565
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,820
I don't know you, right?

566
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,180
It is baffling. I know, I know.

567
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,780
That's why I was able to two step around you.

568
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,200
Describe your two step to me.

569
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,820
How have you bamboozled me in this moment?

570
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,320
Walk me through how you've bamboozled me.

571
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,120
All right, my plan all along was to get caught

572
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,900
so I would get kicked out and you are just scooting me along.

573
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,660
I put my combat boots up on the table.

574
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,480
What's the deal with that steak?

575
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,620
I can't pick it up.

576
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,820
Right, it's for ghosts.

577
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,500
That's ghost food.

578
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,420
Now, I'm gonna be very honest with you.

579
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,260
I don't think you fully know what detention means.

580
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,820
You're not suspended.

581
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,000
Do you recognize me?

582
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,460
See, Luxie says, no.

583
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,480
Because last year I was on the cheer squad.

584
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,120
I was one of the girls that they used to throw up

585
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,120
into the sky because I was so teeny, tiny and cute.

586
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,360
I shouldn't be having a conversation with you alone

587
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:50,880
in the teacher's class.

588
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,820
Get the fuck out of here.

589
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,340
Get out of here. Okay, go leave. All right, good.

590
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,980
Bye. What's your name again? I'm Vice Principal Gold.
